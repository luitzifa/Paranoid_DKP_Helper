# Paranoid DKP Helper
*In the current state the addon is very rudimentary. The data is not editable or extendable ingame.*

If you choose to use it anyway, you may want to edit the loot-table in the addon files, but consider to make a backup because changes will be overwritten by updates.


This addon extends the ingame item tooltip with helpful data for loot management.

The data displayed by this addon contains:
* loot priority
* DKP prices
* further comments to classify the item

The data is provided by a council of my guild Paranoid (EU:Razorfen) and fits our needs.
We have no claim that the data is comprehensive or ready to use for anyone except us.


Todos:
* Make data editable and extendable.
* Synchonization of Data.

Highly inspired by Addon: Checkmate Guild - Herod - Loot Priority Tooltips
