# Paranoid DKP Helper

This addon extends the ingame item tooltip with helpful data for loot management.

The data displayed by this addon contains:
* loot priority
* DKP prices
* further comments to classify the item

The data is provided be a council of my guild Paranoid (EU:Razorfen) and fits our needs.
We have no claim that the data is comprehensive or ready to use for anyone except us.

Highly inspired by Addon: Checkmate Guild - Herod - Loot Priority Tooltips
